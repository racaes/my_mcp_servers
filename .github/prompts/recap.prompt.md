# Project Recap Instructions

When requested, perform a short review of the project status using:

- `MILESTONES.md` → goals and progress
- `copilot-instructions.md` → collaboration guidelines
- `README.md` → documentation and onboarding

Focus on:

1. Checking that milestones, instructions, and documentation are aligned.  
2. Confirming clarity, consistency, and good practices.  
3. Spotting any obsolete or redundant parts from earlier iterations.  
4. Keeping the project direction clear and focused on main goals.

Keep the recap concise, actionable, and oriented toward maintaining alignment and productivity.
